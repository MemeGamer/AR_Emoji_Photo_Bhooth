# AR_Emoji_Photo_Bhooth
This project implements a webâ€‘based AR Emoji Photo Booth using modern browser APIs and MediaPipe. It allows a user to stand in front of the camera, trigger a countdown by raising a hand, overlay a selectable emoji on their face in real time, capture a photo with the chosen emoji, and download the photo via a QR code.
